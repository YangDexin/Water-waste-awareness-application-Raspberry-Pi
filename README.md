# Water waste awareness application-Raspberry Pi
## Introduction: 

In this project, I need to set up the Raspberry Pi, water flow sensors and wirelessly collect water usage data. Then, based on the usage data the light bulb should change the lighting colour. The changing light colour will reflect the water usage for that day, which will make the residents aware and more responsible for their usages.

## Why we need to Conserve Water?

It minimizes the effects of drought and water shortages. Even though our need for fresh water sources is always increasing because of population and industry growth, the supply we have stays constant. Even though water eventually returns to Earth through the water cycle, it's not always returned to the same spot, or in the same quantity and quality. By reducing the amount of water we use, we can better protect against future drought years.It helps to preserve our environment. Water conservation requires forethought and effort, but every little bit helps. Don't think that what you do does not matter. We can all make changes in our lifestyles to reduce our water usage.[2]
